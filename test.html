What happened during the creation was... well, it transformed into this, listen to yourself. Mainly made with GarageBand, with a lot of help of additional AU Plugins like "Helm" from Matt Tytel, the very inspiring Xpand instrument and a lot of sweat from my side.

Why is it called "Taureg Moon Base"? Well, first of its dark intro, which let me think of a deserted moon landscape. Then, because one of the digital instruments I used in Garage Band is called "Taureg Moon Bass", that's the bass line you hear in the middle part of the song.`},

This tune's drums are SID samples, all other voices use more modern software synthesizers. Just a "short shot", keeps you entertained for just one minute.`},

I experienced a lot with the Retro Synth plugin, a software synth emulating the "good old" analog synthesizers. It ended in a somewhat darker mooded song.'}
